How To Approach?
1.Clarify the Question asked to you.
- Do you want me to just give the structure or implement it?
- Are there any specific requirements that needs to be fulfilled?
2.Note down all the possible use cases that could occur in system and then select the ones that are important and can be implemented within time span.
3.Identify the Objects(Entities)
- Real World entity that is gonna take part in system
4.Identify operations supported by objects
5.Relation/Interaction Between Objects
